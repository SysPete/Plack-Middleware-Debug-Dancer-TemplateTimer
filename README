NAME
    Plack::Middleware::Debug::Dancer::TemplateTimer - Template and layout
    rendering timer for Dancer

VERSION
    0.001

SYNOPSIS
    To activate this panel:

        plack_middlewares:
          Debug:
            - panels
            -
              - Dancer::TemplateTimer

    Or by manually creating an app.psgi, that might contain:

        builder {
            enable 'Debug', panels => ['Dancer::TemplateTimer'];
            $app;
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This middleware adds timers around calls to "render" in
    Dancer::Template::Abstract and "layout" in Dancer::Template::Abstract to
    track the time spent rendering the template and the layout for the page.

    This module uses "install_modifier" in Class::Method::Modifiers rather
    than adding hooks since we want to be sure we are only timing the
    template engine and not other code inside hooks.
